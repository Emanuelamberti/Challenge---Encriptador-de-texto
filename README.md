# Hi, I'm Emanuel AdriÃ¡n Lamberti! ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ§  I'm currently learning programming thanks to the ONE-Oracle course in LATAM.
Following the previous knowledge, seen in the virtual classroom, I was entrusted with different challenges to complete during the duration of the course.


# One-Oracle Digital Course Challenges - Part 1 - Text Encryptor

In this first challenge I was entrusted to make a text encrypter using my knowledge in the following languages:
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>CSS3</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>

It had to contain images and colors previously defined by the ONE platform, and had to follow the following principles:

<ul>
    <li>The letter "a" must be replaced by "ai"</li>
    <li>The letter "e" must be replaced by "enter"</li>
    <li>The letter "i" must be replaced by "imes"</li>
    <li>The letter "o" must be replaced by "ober"</li>
    <li>The letter "u" must be replaced by "ufat"</li>
</ul>


At the same time, the following should be respected:

<ul>
    <li>It should work only with lowercase letters</li>
    <li>Letters with accents or special characters must not be used</li>
    <li>It must be possible to convert a word to the encrypted version as well as return an encrypted word to its original version.</li>
    <li>The result should be seen on the screen</li>
</ul>
